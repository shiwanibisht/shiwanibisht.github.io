<h2> 2048 AI Solver </h2>
See it in action <a href="/2048AI">here</a>.

This was created in conjunction with 2 other students while taking the Practicum in AI course at Cornell University. Forked from the existing AI framework created <a href="https://github.com/ov3y/2048-AI">here</a>, we implemented DFS, Minimax (with alpha-beta pruning), and Expectiminimax to beat 2048.

Source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/shiwanibisht/2048AI">here</a>.
